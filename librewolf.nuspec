    <summary>A fork of Firefox, focused on privacy, security and freedom.</summary>
    <description>This project is an independent “fork” of Firefox, with the primary goals of privacy security and user freedom. It is the community run successor to [LibreFox](https://github.com/intika/Librefox)

LibreWolf is designed to minimize data collection and telemetry as much as possible. This is achieved through hundreds of privacy/security/performance settings and patches. Intrusive integrated addons including updater, crashreporter, and pocket are removed too.

**LibreWolf is NOT associated with Mozilla or its products.**

## Features

- **Latest Firefox** — LibreWolf is compiled directly from the latest build of Firefox Stable. You will have the the latest features, and security updates.
- **Independent Build** — LibreWolf uses a build independent of Firefox and has its own settings, profile folder and installation path. As a result, it can be installed alongside Firefox or any other browser.
- **No phoning home** — Embedded server links and other calling home functions are removed. In other words, *minimal background connections* by default.
- User settings updates — We keep up with [gHacks-user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js) and [pyllyukko's user.js](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js)
- Extensions firewall: limit internet access for extensions.
- Multi-platform
- Community-Driven</description>
